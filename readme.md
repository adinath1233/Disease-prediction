# Disease Prediction System

## Project Overview
This project is designed to predict potential diseases based on three symptoms provided by the user. The system analyzes the symptoms and predicts which disease might be present, along with a description of the disease. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to help in early disease detection. 

The project is built using **Flask** for creating a web-based application. The purpose of this project is purely academic, aiming to demonstrate disease prediction and symptom analysis.

## System Requirements

- **Anaconda Environment** with Python 3.10 version
- **Required Libraries**: All required Python libraries can be installed via the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Create an Anaconda environment** with Python 3.10:
    ```bash
    conda create --name disease-prediction python=3.10
    ```

2. **Activate the environment**:
    ```bash
    conda activate disease-prediction
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies** using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Flask application** by executing the following command:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    This will start the Flask server, and you can access the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is available on **Kaggle**. It contains various symptoms and their corresponding diseases, allowing the system to make predictions based on the symptoms provided by the user.

- **Dataset source**: The dataset can be found on Kaggle (no direct link available).

## Credits

- The dataset used for training the prediction model is available on Kaggle.
- This project was built for academic purposes to demonstrate disease prediction using machine learning and web development.
